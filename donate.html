    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Help Provide the Technology Required for In-Need Students to Find Success in a Virtual Learning Enviroment.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How We Started</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, there was a pandemic that disrupted daily life and forced millions of students to obtain their knowledge through small glowing screens. No, this was not the first line of a Sci-Fi Thriller. The time is now and those glowing screens are called laptops. Unfortunately, not every student has access to such devices, which have now become the gateway to their educations.
    </p>

     <p>
      As a student, I would hear firsthand the inconviences posed by E-Learning from my peers. From not being able to meet with teachers in person to the occasional WiFi crash during class, E-Learning poses a variety of challenges to students. However, all of these inconviences pale in comparison to the struggles of students who are forced to share a single device with siblings in other grades or simply do not have access to a device. <strong>For too many of these students, E-Learning means no learning</strong>, a reality that simply does not align with our belief that education is a human right.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How We Help</strong></h3>

    <p>
      Often families can find themselves with extra devices, whether from graduating a school or upgrading to a newer device. Yet, many of these devices can have life changing impacts on students who may not have access to them. Even though some families recognize this meaningful potential, many simply do not know where to donate their device to ensure that it provide these opportunities to in-need students.
    </p>

    <p>
      Providing this valuable connection and establishing a platform for donations lies at the core of our mission. By offering direct and easy donations (Check Out How It Works For Details on Our Donation Process), we hope to encourage device donations and assist in-need students in our area. All donations are carefully inspected, refurbished, and reset by our experienced team, ensuring that students recieve devices ready to support their learning from the start.
    </p>
