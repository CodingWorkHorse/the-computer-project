    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Step 1: Fill Out Donation Form</strong></h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      The first step to putting your donation in the hands of students is filling out a quick <a href="https://forms.gle/f8VP5ycqkVuRJJ9f8" target="_blank"> form</a>, which should take no more than a few minutes. By providing your contact information and answering a few questions about your device, we can follow up with you as soon as possible and have a better idea of the specifications and condition of your donation, allowing us to put your device to use sooner. The form can be accessed <a href="https://forms.gle/f8VP5ycqkVuRJJ9f8" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;"> here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Step 2: Receive Donation Feedback & Schedule a Collection Time</strong></h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      After reviewing your form submission, we will follow up via your preferred contact method and determine how your donation can best be utilized at the moment. Depending on your choosen donation option (Contactless Pick-Up or Drop-Off), a tentative time and date will be selected subject to availability. Your donation will be confirmed prior to the scheduled time. Please refer to our <a href="donate.html" style="text-decoration: underline;"> How We Keep Donations Safe</a> section for more details on the donation collection and how we are putting safety first during these challenging times.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Step 3: Donation Collected</strong></h3>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Whether you opt for contactless pick-up or drop-off at one of our Donation Locations, you will be assured your donation will be collected in a simple and safe manner. In order to ensure your safety, we are taking appropriate precautions which can be read about here. When your device is collected you will receive a Letter of Donation via email, confirming that your donation has been successfully processed. Please allow up to 72 hours for processing.
    </p>

     <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Step 4: Device Cleaning & Refurbishment</strong></h3>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
     In order to ensure that students receive a fresh device ready to empower their learning, we take time to sanitize and refurbish all devices. In addition to freshening them up, attention is given to see that the device receives a "factory reset", helping to make certain that your existing information is wiped off your donated device. Once the device has been refurbished, your donation is fresh and ready to find its way to those who can benefit most from it.
    </p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Step 5: Device Allocated To a Student In-Need</strong></h3>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Last but certainly not least, your device is distributed to students in need. Leveraging our strategic partnerships with fantastic organizations, such as <a href="https://www.fillaheart4kids.org/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Fill a Heart 4 Kids</a>, and local schools, we connect your donation to in-need students right after it is collected. In the Digital Age, providing students with E-Learning Devices not only offers the valuable tool needed to continue their formal education, but opens the door to the abundant opportunities for developing valuable technology skills that can open future career paths in an evolving economy.
